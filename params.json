The purpose of this library is to provide a set of tools for indexing/dividing a set of data on a spherical coordinate system (i.e. geospatial metadata) using a quad-tree indexing scheme applied to a quad-cube cartographic projection.  Four projections are supported: Tangental (TSC), COBE (CSC), Quadrilateralized (QSC), and HEALpix (HSC).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
